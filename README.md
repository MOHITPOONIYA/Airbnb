Features
User Authentication: Secure user sign-up, login, and logout functionality using Passport.js.

CRUD Operations: Users can create, read, update, and delete their own property listings.

Image Uploads: Seamless image uploads to the cloud using Multer and Cloudinary, with optimized image transformations for faster loading.

Reviews and Ratings: Authenticated users can leave star ratings and written reviews on listings.

Interactive Maps: Each listing displays its location on an interactive map using the Mapbox API, with geocoding to convert location names into coordinates.

Authorization & Middleware: Robust middleware ensures that only authenticated users can perform certain actions (like creating listings) and only property owners can edit or delete their listings.

Flash Messaging: Provides users with helpful feedback and alerts for actions like successful logins or errors.

Responsive Design: A clean and modern UI built with Bootstrap and EJS, ensuring a great experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

Tech Stack
This project is built with the following technologies:

Backend: Node.js, Express.js

Database: MongoDB with Mongoose

Templating Engine: EJS (Embedded JavaScript) with EJS-Mate for layouts

Authentication: Passport.js (with passport-local) for session management

File Uploads: Multer and Cloudinary for cloud-based image storage

Mapping: Mapbox API for geocoding and interactive maps

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap

Utilities: method-override for PUT and DELETE requests, connect-flash for flash messages, dotenv for environment variable management
